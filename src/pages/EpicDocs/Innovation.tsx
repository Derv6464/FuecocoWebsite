        <h2> Broad User Group Selection </h2>
        <p>
          My board user group for this product is people who have a large
          interest in pokémon. These people will most likely be between the ages
          of 18-30. This user group is suitable for my product as my robootic
          pokémon alignes with their interests.
        </p>
        <h2> Broad User Group Description </h2>
        <p>
          Pokémon is a massive world-wide brand. The Pokémon Company (Nintendo)
          take up 0.8 percent of the toy market and 5.7 percent of the games
          market in Western Europe in 2022.This percentage has grown in the last
          5 years.<sup>[1]</sup>{" "}

        <p>
          In recent year, the Pokémon age demographic has shifted to be older
          and older. This is reflected in Nintendo’s “Nine Months Financial
          Results Briefing for Fiscal Year Ending March 2017”. Which states the
          there is an increasing number of players in their 20s and 30s. Similar
          statistics can be seen when looking at the Pokémon Go age
          demographics. The 21-30 age range accounted for 58% of the player base
          in 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
          This shows that while an older age demographic makes up a large
          portion of the market. Many of the merchandise is targeted towards
          children. My product appeals to the older age demographic, as it is
          more complex than a regular Pokémon toy, with lighting and movement
          features. The size is also accurate to the canonical size of Fuecoco
          (0.4m).{" "}

          This product will be initially sold in Ireland. To get an idea of the
          Irish market, we can look at Dublin Comic Con. The convention has
          20,000 attendee per year. From a survey done by Eventbrite in 2014, it
          found that convention attendees tend to have an interest in many
          genres, including video games, and the main age demographic is between
          18- 29. This shows that there is a market in Ireland for my product.

        <p>
          I choose to segment my marking by psychographic. This is as my user
          group has specific hobbies and lifestyles. I am looking for users who
          have an interest in pokemon{" "}
